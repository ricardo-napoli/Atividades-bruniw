Come And Go
<br>
I come and go just like
I have nothing to say
And it wouldn't hurt at all
If you walked away
</p>
</font>
<br>


I come and go just like
I'm supposed to do like this
And your presence wouldn't be
Something I would miss
So I come and go...
<br><br>



I come and go just like
Those waves that washed our summer
From our minds, photos
Pockets and empty diaries
I come and go just like
That's just how it's meant to be
But I always ask myself
Why don't you come and go with me
<br><br>



Come with me
Is that what you really want?
Come with me
Is that what you've tried to do all the time?
Come with me
I'll be waiting right there by the corner
Come with me
Until we end up tired
Or leave me alone
Don't leave me alone.
